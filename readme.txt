Organize plugins in the Plugins Admin Page by creating groups and filter types

== Description ==

If you have a lot of plugins installed, it can be difficult to manage them all. Now you can organize the plugins admin page by grouping your plugins by purpose. Each group will be displayed as a plugin status tabs in the plugins admin page, so you can easily filter which plugins you are viewing by group.

A free plugin by [David Cramer](https://cramer.co.za).
